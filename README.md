# Molia DHT

A high-performance, production-ready Distributed Hash Table (DHT) implementation designed for Internet-scale deployment with security, privacy, and operability as first-class concerns.

IMPORTANT: Project in research and design phase. Drafts only.

---

## Overview

Molia is a modern DHT built on Kademlia's XOR metric with significant enhancements for production use:

- **Sub-second lookups** at Internet scale (median ≤300ms, P95 ≤1s)
- **Zero-allocation hot paths** for predictable performance
- **Shared-nothing architecture** for maximum scalability
- **WireGuard-based transport security** with built-in Sybil resistance
- **First-class NAT traversal** and browser support
- **Privacy-preserving lookups** with query blinding

### Key Features

- **Security**: Ed25519 identity, WireGuard encryption, proof-of-work admission control
- **Performance**: Lock-free per-core sharding, zero-allocation design, batched I/O
- **Reliability**: Erasure coding, adaptive replication, graceful degradation
- **Operability**: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, rolling upgrades
- **Privacy**: Query blinding, two-hop relays, minimal metadata exposure

## Documentation Structure

### Core Concepts
- **[Kademlia Algorithm](docs/core/kademlia.md)** - DHT fundamentals, XOR metric, k-buckets, iterative lookups

### Architecture

- **[Transport & NAT Traversal](docs/networking/transport-nat-traversal.md)** - UDP stack, hole punching, relay strategies, WebRTC fallback
- **[Wire Protocol](docs/networking/wire-protocol.md)** - RPC messages, encoding, versioning, negotiation

### Security
- **[WireGuard Integration](docs/security/wireguard-integration.md)** - Per-shard crypto, session management, MTU handling
- **[Sybil Resistance](docs/security/sybil-resistance.md)** - Proof-of-work, admission tokens, rate limiting, behavioral scoring

### Advanced
- **[Linux eBPF Optimization](docs/advanced/linux-reuseport-ebpf.md)** - SO_REUSEPORT with eBPF steering for WireGuard packet demux

## Design Principles

1. **Security by Default**: Silent before handshake, authenticated all traffic, proof-of-work gated
2. **Zero-Trust Networking**: Every peer is untrusted; validate everything
3. **Fail Gracefully**: Degrade performance under attack, never fail open
4. **Observable**: Rich metrics, structured logs, distributed tracing
5. **Upgradeable**: Rolling protocol upgrades, feature negotiation
6. **Privacy-Aware**: Minimize metadata leakage, support query blinding

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust (recommended)
- **Crypto**: 
  - Identity: Ed25519 (ed25519-dalek)
  - Hashing: BLAKE3 (blake3)
  - Transport: WireGuard (boringtun)
- **Encoding**: Protocol Buffers (prost)
- **I/O**: tokio (per-shard single-threaded runtimes)
- **Storage**: Per-shard WAL with periodic compaction

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (recommended)
- Linux 5.3+ for eBPF features (optional)
- UDP connectivity (NAT traversal support included)

### Building
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cargo test
cargo test --features allocation-tracking  # Verify zero-alloc paths
```

### Running a Node
```bash
./target/release/molia --bootstrap <seed-addrs>
```

---

## Performance Targets

- **Lookup Latency**: P50 ≤300ms, P95 ≤1s, P99 ≤2s
- **Throughput**: 100K+ lookups/sec per 8-core node
- **Hot Path**: Zero allocations in steady state
- **Per-Packet CPU**: ≤5μs median at 3.5 GHz
- **Churn Resilience**: 95%+ success rate at 30% nodes joining/leaving per minute

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios
- **Churn Soak**: 30% join/leave rate, maintain ≥95% lookup success
- **Partition Heal**: Regional isolation recovery
- **Adversarial**: 20% Sybils near target prefix
- **NAT Matrix**: Full-cone, symmetric, restricted NAT types
- **Data Durability**: Random node failures with erasure-coded recovery

### Verification
- Zero-allocation tests with custom allocator tracking
- Fuzz testing of wire protocol and codecs
- Chaos engineering (network partitions, node crashes)
- Security audits of crypto and admission control

---

## Deployment Considerations

### Recommended Configuration
- **Shard Count**: Number of physical cores (default)
- **Bucket Size (K)**: 20 peers per bucket
- **Parallelism (α)**: 4 concurrent lookups
- **TTL**: 24h for mutable records, 5-30min for cached content
- **Erasure Coding**: 10:4 (data:parity) for blobs ≥1MB

### Observability
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Structured JSON logs with privacy scrubbers
- Optional distributed tracing (opt-in per request)
- Grafana dashboards for SLOs and regional heatmaps

### Security Hardening
- Enable proof-of-work with adaptive difficulty
- Configure per-/24 and per-ASN rate limits
- Set relay budget caps (≤10% egress recommended)
- Enable query blinding for privacy-sensitive deployments
